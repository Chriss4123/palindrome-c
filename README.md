# Palindrome C

Find the longest palindromic substring in a string. Written in C.

## Installation and Updating
### Install & Update Script

To **install** or **update** palindrome, you should run the installation script. To do that, you can either download and run the script manually, or use the following cURL command:
```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ | cat > install.sh && sudo bash install.sh && rm install.sh
```
Running the above command downloads a script and runs it. This script clones the palindrome C file to your computer, automatically builds it and then appends the built file to **/usr/bin/palindrome**. Because of this, it requires **sudo** permission. This doesn't stop you from manually downloading the C file and building it yourself if you don't need it in **/usr/bin/palindrome**.

After installation, you can run **palindrome** and use the **help** paramater to get information about the script.
